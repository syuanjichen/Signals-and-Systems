# Signals-and-Systems
The MATLAB homework of Signals and Systems by Prof. Yu-Chiang Wang, Spring 2024

## Homework 1
- Compare the results of convolution using `conv()` function and from definition. (There will be a 1-unit time shift between them).

## Homework 2
- Use MATLAB fft function to calculate the Fourier transform of a signal
- Hanning window and observation of Gibbs phenomenon

## Homework 3
- Use `freqz`, `butter` and `filter` to design and apply digital filters

## Homework 4
- Use `residuez`, `zplane`, `roots`, `zp2sos` along with `freqz` and `butter` to implement z-transform.
